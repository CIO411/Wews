### A refreshing news aggregator app for the modern Web

#### Abstract
This project aims to become an engaging and visually-appealing application for the daily digestion of *news articles* from various sources (*Wired, BBC, MSN* etc.).
To this end, the user interface exhibits a convenient *sidebar* area (accessible via the *'Wews'* logo) providing various useful settings - such as *'Ordering', 'Sources', 'Sharing'* etc;
also, the top *header* area boasts an immediately accessible search field, offering live *suggestions* upon typing.

*Responsiveness* is the fundamental principle of this project, thus the main *catalog* area adjusts its columns to fit the available space, while the *sidebar* takes precedence when the screen becomes reasonably small.

#### Development
The source code leverages the latest Web technologies and techniques towards offering the most aesthetical and fluid user experience currently available, following modern code-style recommendations while also being [*SUIT CSS*](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md) compliant.
